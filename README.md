  I am creating an employee tracker to help a company track their employees. You'll be able to add Departments, Roles, and Employees, update the roles of the Employees, and view all Departments, Roles, and Employees.

## Usage
  
  Run the SQL statements in db/schema.sql in pg admin to create the database. You can also update the starter data
  in seeds.sql to include starting data. 
  
  Run 'npm i' to install dependencies. 
  
  Finally, run 'node server.js' to start the server and follow the prompts.

  Here is a short video walkthrough of the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KT0uRrF2gHuYhQuj8rON6eeXc8iKh766/view
